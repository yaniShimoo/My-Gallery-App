My app description: 
Today, countless talented individuals express themselves through painting. We see them everywhere — in the media and on city streets — showcasing their creations into which they’ve poured endless hours and passion.

Our application is designed to address the challenges these artists face, by streamlining the sales process and boosting the efficiency of their emerging art businesses.

The idea was born out of my own personal journey. As an artist for nearly a decade, I often dreamed of turning my creativity into a sustainable business and earning from my hard work. This experience allowed me to step into the shoes of potential users and truly understand what artists like me need in order to simplify their path and successfully grow their artistic ventures.
